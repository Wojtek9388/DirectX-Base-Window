# DirectX-Base-Window
A base window that has D2D and D3D.
I have not cleaned up the code from a late night coding session that I gave up with pascal case halfway through on.

# Adding Built in Imgui and D2D.
I have not currently added a D2D interop layer to be able to create D2D overlays with D3D for Imgui.
- [x] Added functioning Imgui for overlay config.
- [] D2D drawing support.
- [] Added Transparency and click through (other than when Imgui window is open).

# Usage
you have to set the path to msys64/mingw64/bin for the dlls to be copied into the build directory
